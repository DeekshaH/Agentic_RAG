{"timestamp": "2025-09-14T15:15:40.888262", "question": "what is In context prompting?", "answer": "In-context prompting, also known as prompt engineering, refers to methods for communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs) to steer their behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science, and its effects can vary significantly among models, requiring experimentation and heuristics. The goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability.", "rating": "positive"}
{"timestamp": "2025-09-14T15:44:23.430757", "question": "what are instructions for prompting?", "answer": "Instructions for prompting involve providing clear, specific, and structured natural language instructions to the model on what to do. A prompt can contain information like the instruction or question you are passing to the model and include other details such as context, inputs, or examples. When prompting in this way, it is referred to as zero-shot prompting.", "rating": "negative"}

{"timestamp": "2025-09-14T21:52:29.103680", "question": "what is In context prompting?", "answer": "In-context learning is a prompt engineering technique where examples or demonstrations of the task are provided to the model within the prompt. This allows large language models to solve new tasks without fine-tuning. It enables the model to learn from a small set of examples presented in the prompt at inference time.", "rating": "positive"}
{"timestamp": "2025-09-14T21:52:59.922503", "question": "what is an llm", "answer": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text. It utilizes machine learning techniques to understand and generate human language. LLMs can be used to generate and translate text.", "rating": "negative"}
{"timestamp": "2025-09-20T15:47:41.533829", "question": "what are AI Agents?", "answer": "AI agents are software programs that interact with their environment, collect data, and use that data to perform self-directed tasks to meet predetermined goals. They are autonomous software tools that perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment intelligently and rationally. These agents can also understand and respond to customer inquiries without human intervention.", "rating": "positive"}
